1.28
	- Bugfix in the http module. The POST should obviously have the client
	upload data to the server, not the other way round. Fixed now.
	Bug found and reported by Nick Mavis. Thank you!
	- Some minor edits in file2pcap.h and file2pcap.c so that file2pcap
	will compile with -fno-common

1.27
	Bugfix in the ftp module. Due to an earlier code change, the data to
	"send" was missing completely in the pcaps. So the ftp module was not 
	operational. Fixed now. Thanks for reporting and fixing the issue Kelly!

1.26
	Bugfix in file2pcap.c. The -h flag would occasionally result in a
	crash when used in combination with other flags, due to a missing
	default case for an if() clause.
	Bug reported by Mike Bautista. Thank you Mike!

1.25
	Added gzip compression for HTTP
	Added chunked encoding for HTTP
	New parameter: --block-size. Allows to specify the payload size in
	each packet
	New parameter: --http-encoder. Allows to specify default, chunked,
	gzip or gzip+chunked encoding for HTTP transfer
	Source and destination IPv4 addresses can now be specified
	Source and destination email addresses can now be specified

1.24
	Added support for HTTP/2 GET requests
	Added uuencoding for email attachments
	- CAUTION! While uuencoding for smtp should be fine, pop3 and imap have not been verified!
	The pop3 pcaps had an invalid boundary separating the attachment - fixed
	Fixed mail headers in smtp.c for several encodings

1.23
	Filenames including spaces and similar characters are now more properly encoded in a URL
	Added a check to prevent output file and input file being the same

1.22
	Fixed HTTP POST. Now the content length is correct

1.21
	Added HTTP POST support

1.2
	Fixed a bug that made the code mix up the ethernet addresses, resulting in src_ip(and dst_ip) and src_ether(and dst_ether) suddenly matching src_ip but dst_ether,
	so from an ethernet point of view the packets were going in a different direction than from an IP point of view

	Added ftp support

	Renamed tcpTeardown() to tcpShutdown()

1.11
	Fixed a small bug in the http part, which resulted in the 4 closing tcp packets to have the wrong timestamp. Thanks Eric Moret (eric.moretATgmail.com) !

1.1
	Now supports IPv6
	Bit of a cleanup in the code

1.0
	Changed the version number, for release :)	

0.97
	Adding quoted-printable encoding(experimental)
	Added -e option for setting the encoder (base64/mime or quoted printable)
0.96
	Fixed headers in helpers.c. Compiles on BSD again now.
	Fixed encoding issue where an extra byte was smuggled between the data and the equal(=) signs at the very end of the data
	Changed a memset in helpers.c. Before, a byte past the buffer was nulled.

0.95
	Finally really fixed that bug in the encoding function. It was an off-by-one basically, where bytes at the end and past the malloc'd buffer were used and influenced the encoding result

0.94
	Fixed a major bug in the mime encoding. Previous base64/mime encoding was NOT done correctly. Smtp/Pop3/Imap pcaps created with file2pcap < version 0.94 will likely have attachments incorrectly encoded.

0.93
	Fixed attachment type and filename of the imap attachment
	Fixed attachment type and filename of the pop3 attachment

0.92
	Now also works on BSD
